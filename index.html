                            <p class="card-text">Batman is one of the most iconic and enduring superheroes in the world of comic books and pop culture. Created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Batman made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Unlike many other superheroes, Batman possesses no superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his intelligence, physical prowess, and an array of high-tech gadgets to fight crime in Gotham City.At the core of Batman's character is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire philanthropist who witnessed the murder of his parents as a child. This traumatic event fueled his lifelong commitment to eradicating crime. Adopting the persona of Batman, he becomes a symbol of fear for criminals, donning a bat-themed costume and using his extensive martial arts training to combat villains. Batman's rogues' gallery includes iconic foes like the Joker, Two-Face, and the Penguin, each with their unique motivations and quirks. His unwavering dedication to justice and moral code make him a complex and compelling character, as he navigates the fine line between hero and vigilante. Over the decades, Batman has been portrayed in various media, including comic books, television series, animated shows, and numerous blockbuster films, cementing his status as a symbol of justice, darkness, and the enduring human spirit.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"> Nagraj is a superhero appearing in Indian comic books published by Raj Comics[1] created in the late 1980s by Rajkumar Gupta.[2] Nagraj first appeared in the comics Nagraj GENL #14 which was written by Parshuram Sharma and illustrated by Pratap Mullick.
                                After that Sanjay Ashtpure, Pratap Mullick, Chandu, Milind Misal and Vitthal Kamble alternately illustrated the character for 44 issues, ending in 1995 with Visarpi Ki Shadi.[3][4][5][6]                               
                                Nagraj is believed to have been inspired by the mythological Ichchhadhari Nag (shapeshifting snakes) and historical Vishmanushya (venomous human).[7] His stories create a rich blend of mythology, fantasy, magic, and science fiction. Many of Nagraj's fans believe that, over time, Nagraj's comics have developed snake mythology of its own, which is unique to the popular Indian beliefs about snakes that are prevalent among the masses. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">Thor is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. In Norse mythology, he is a hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the protection of humankind, hallowing, and fertility. Thor, deity common to all the early Germanic peoples, a great warrior represented as a red-bearded, middle-aged man of enormous strength, an implacable foe to the harmful race of giants but benevolent toward mankind. His figure was generally secondary to that of the god Odin, who in some traditions was his father; but in Iceland, and perhaps among all northern peoples except the royal families, he was apparently worshiped more than any other god. There is evidence that a corresponding deity named Thunor, or Thonar, was worshiped in England and continental Europe, but little is known about him. </p>

                            <!-- Description of your superhero-->
                            <p class="card-text"> Doctor Strange, originally a Marvel Comics character created in 1963, underwent a fascinating evolution from page to screen. In the comics, he's Dr. Stephen Strange, a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon who turns to mysticism after a car accident wrecks his hands. He trains under the Ancient One to become the Sorcerer Supreme, safeguarding Earth from supernatural threats.
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), actor Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Doctor Strange. His 2016 solo film introduced audiences to the character's origin, emphasizing the mystical and mind-bending aspects. He later played vital roles in "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame."
Doctor Strange's transition to film retained his complex character, mystical abilities, and signature artifacts like the Eye of Agamotto. The MCU also explores his role in the multiverse, expanding the narrative possibilities. This adaptation successfully brought the enigmatic world of magic to the big screen, making Doctor Strange a pivotal figure in the cinematic superhero landscape. </p>
